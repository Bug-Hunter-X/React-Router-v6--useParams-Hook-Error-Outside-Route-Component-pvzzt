The solution involves ensuring that the component using `useParams` is nested within a `<Route>` component.  This provides the necessary routing context for the hook to function correctly.
```javascript
import { useParams, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams(); 
  return <div>ID: {id}</div>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/:id" element={<MyComponent />}/>
    </Routes>
  );
}
```
In this corrected example, `MyComponent` is now within a `<Route>`, granting it access to the routing context and allowing `useParams` to function as expected.
